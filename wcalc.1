.SH NAME
wcalc - a natural-expression command-line calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wcalc
[-h|--help] [-E] [-P#] [-M#] [-v|--version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wcalc is a command-line calculator designed to accept all valid mathematical
expressions. It supports all standard mathematical operations, parenthesis,
brackets, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic trig functions, logs, and
boolean operators.
.br
If no mathematical expression is given at the commandline, wcalc enters
"interactive" mode. Interactive mode has more features and accepts
expressions with spaces. Also, files may be piped to wcalc, and they will be
interpreted.
