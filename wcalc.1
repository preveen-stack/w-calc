.TH wcalc 1
.SH NAME
wcalc - a natural-expression command-line calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wcalc
[--help] [-E] [-P#] [-M#] [-v|--version] [-d] [-h] [-o] [-p] [-l] [-r]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wcalc is a command-line calculator designed to accept all valid mathematical
expressions. It supports all standard mathematical operations, parenthesis,
brackets, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic trig functions, logs, and
boolean operators.
.br
If no mathematical expression is given at the commandline, wcalc enters
"interactive" mode. Interactive mode has more features and accepts
expressions with spaces. Also, files may be piped to wcalc, and they will be
interpreted.
.br
Variables are supported and may be assigned using the = operator. To assign
a variable use the form:
.I "foo = anylegalexpression"
Thereafter, that variable name is the same as the literal value it represents.
Expressions can be stored in variables like this:
.I "foo = 'anylegalexpression'
Expressions stored this way will be interpreted at evaluation time, rather
than assignment-time.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-h \-\-help"
Either one prints a help usage message to standard output, then exits.
.TP
.I "\-E"
Specifies that numerical output should be in scientific notation.
.TP
.I "\-P"
Followed by an integer, it sets the precision.
.br
Precision is set to autoadjust (-1) by default.
.br
Example: wcalc -P6
.TP
.I "\-v \-\-version"
Either one prints the version number and exits.
.TP
.I "\-d \-dec \-\-decimal"
Prints the output in decimal form.
.TP
.I "\-h \-hex \-\-hexadecimal"
Prints the output in hexadecimal form.
.TP
.I "\-o \-oct \-\-octal"
Prints the output in octal form.
.TP
.I "\-b \-bin \-\-binary"
Prints the output in binary form.
.TP
.I "\-p"
Toggles printing prefixes for hexadecimal, octal, and binary forms.
.TP
.I "\-l \-\-lenient"
Makes the parser assume that uninitialized variables have a value of zero.
.TP
.I "\-r \-\-radians"
Makes all trigonometric functions work in radians.
