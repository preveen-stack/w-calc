					Wcalc is a more capable calculator than the one that comes with the default Mac OS X. It has standard functions (sin, asin, and sinh for example), defined constants (pi, e), support for using variables, a history, and an expandable expression entry field.
					<p>
					Wcalc also comes in a command-line version that works on most (if not all) forms of Unix (including Linux and BSD).
					<p>
					<font color="%FF0000">HELP!</font> Wcalc needs an icon!
					<p>
					<h3>Status</h3>
					I started a Yahoo Groups email list for Wcalc - anyone interested in talking about Wcalc with a larger group, getting emails about features and bugs and the future direction of Wcalc, send a message <a href="mailto:wcalc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">here</a>.
					<p><hr><font size="-1">
					Good grief! 1.4.4 is out... I really need a regiment of tests to run before I release software. Suggestions? Help?
					<p>Damon Bransom has kindly sent me <a href="icons1.jpg">a few icon suggestions</a> - <a href="mailto:memoryhole@mac.com">what do you think</a>?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.3 is out!
					<p>I can't believe I didn't find these errors earlier. Good grief...
					<p>Someone suggested to me that I start a mailing list, on Yahoo Groups or something, for people interested in Wcalc development (heck, even throw the source out there, GPL it, see if people can help me make it cool). Is this something that's a good idea? Anyone interested? Or should this remain my little hobby?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.2 is out!
					<p>So, I decided to release earlier rather than later. This fixes all but one of the bugs that I *know* about (the other one... eh). Working on customizable functions.
					<p><hr>
					Well, I've got the period/comma problem solved (sorta). I'm treating them interchangeably. I'd <i>like</i> to be able to specify which to use in the preferences, so that 1,000.5 can be interpreted to be one thousand point five (in America) instead of one thousand multiplied by one half - but that's... <b><u>REALLY</u></b> hard at the moment. (If anyone knows how to change the Lex regular expressions on the fly, let me know!)
					<p>I also have the button-click-means-you-can't-type-anymore problem solved. (It was, in the end, a stupid error on my part.) Basically, the setSelectable:TRUE is not the inverse of setSelectable:FALSE.
					<p>I'm currently working on two things:<ul>
						<li>fix the library problems for real this time (I can't figure out how to link libraries in statically - but I'm working on it).
						<li>Add a drawer with all the functions and symbols in it (and put output format (read: hex) controls there... maybe).
					</ul>
					What do you think? More feature suggestions? More bug reports? Are these features good to go? Should I release 1.4.2 (with what is currently fixed) before I release 1.5?
					<p>
					Someone also suggested that I start a listserv for Wcalc. Any seconds?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.1 is out!
					<p>
					This version is almost all bugfixes. It was brought to my attention that there were some really important bugs (particularly with the command-line) that I just had to fix them immediately.
					<p>
					There are still one or two bugs left to quash (aren't there always?)... some of them I'm almost beginning to wonder if it's really me (like the window-resizing thing).
					<p>
					Things I'm looking at for the next version: saving variable sets, user-defined functions, functions of multiple variables... any more suggestions?
					<p><hr>
					1.4 is out!
					<p>
					This version has a bunch of features that have been suggested to me - the history is being saved now, it supports hex,octal,and binary for input and output, the history list also saves the result of the expression. There are also some bug fixes that people noticed - better factorials, clearing out pointless error messages, that kind of thing. I also improved the command-line version a bunch (added new features, implemented the new command syntax, that sort of thing).
					<p>
					As a side-note, MacWorld will be including Wcalc with their May issue!!! (I'm excited!)
					<p>
					I took some of the older versions offline - some were broken, fundamentally, and I need the space on my iDisk.
					<p><hr>
					1.3 is out!
					<p>
					I found another error in the parser (it was doing the order of operations backwards!). Ahh, well... I may have to rewrite it again, from scratch. Anyway - as requested, you can toggle the keypad. I also found a bunch of tables of standard physical constants, and thought it would be neat to add those, and as a way to show it off, I added menus to select them. Fun stuff.
					<p><hr>
					1.2 is out!
					<p>
					Wow. Well, when you start rewriting the parser, I guess you just can't stop until you're completely finished, or things break. Sorry about that, everyone - 1.1 and 1.1.1's parsers were broken, so things didn't work. 1.2 <b>should</b> work -- if it doesn't, let me know right away!
					<p><hr>
					1.1.1 is out! EEEK! A typo in the parser! Ick!
					<p><hr>
					1.1 is out! This fixes a LOT more than I thought it would. I didn't realize the parser was as broken as it was (yow!) - but it's much better now.
					<p>
					The command-line tool needs to be brought up to par with the GUI - there are a few preferences and things of that nature that the GUI has that the command-line tool doesn't. And I may need to create a ~/.wcalcrc to store preferences...
					<p>
					One thing I *still* can't figure out... There seems to be a wierd window-resize bug, where it will get a little bigger to the left, and then the size of the window misbehaves (doesn't follow the mouse). Is this just my machine?</font>
					<p>
