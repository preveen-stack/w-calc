					Wcalc is a more capable calculator than the one that comes with the default Mac OS X. It has standard functions (sin, asin, and sinh for example), defined constants (pi, e), support for using variables, a history, and an expandable expression entry field.
					<p>
					Wcalc also comes in a command-line version that works on most (if not all) forms of Unix (including Linux and BSD).
					<p>
					<h3>Status</h3>
					<p>1.5.1 is out!
					<p>Two months later, not much has changed. Jaguar came out - compatability was a simple recompile away. (If you're curious, Apple moved the termcap functions from libSystem.B.dylib to libtermcap - which is the "correct" place for those functions.) I was alerted (thanks Chris!) to some precision issues in Wcalc. The problem was that C doubles can't accurately compute equivalence for numbers less than about 2.2e-16 apart. In order to represent numbers as accurately as I could, I put in checks, so that numbers that are less than that far away from an integer are rounded to that integer (that way 1 - 0.9 - 0.1 returns zero). This doesn't work so well for really small numbers - like Plank's constant. So, I added a toggle to turn off my precision checks. It's not a great fix, but it's better than the full solution, which is to implement my own number representation, and re-implement all the standard functions (if you know of a good way to get unlimited precision - please, let me know!).
					<p>Anyway, there's a new version out. Go <a href="download.html">fetch</a>!
					<hr><font size=-1>
					<p>Howdy!
					<p>Well, it seems that releasing took a little longer than I planned (big surprise, eh?) With the time I updated the man page and online-help, so those should be working (still no online GUI help...).
					<p>Anyway, I'm really proud of this one. The conversion support is solid, extensible, and has a gazillion units. Active variable support is finally done (which should help those of you who want to do functions with it). It doesn't check for recursion, so you can put it in an infinite loop... I'll try to fix that, but figured that could wait a little bit. There are also all sorts of little fixes and feature additions (live keypresses!) here and there. <a href="download.html">I hope you like it!</a>
					<p>Next on the field of features to get done... I want to be able to detect recursion instead of infinitely looping and eventually crashing. From there it's PRINTING and SAVING FILES! There's nothing to stop me now! (famous last words, of course).
					<p>One last note about the new URL... I want to move off of Notre Dame's servers as quickly as possible (I was forced on here after Apple decided to charge for mac.com webspace). I plan to open-source Wcalc by (or when) it turns 2.0 (which will be when printing and saving/opening files works), and I'll move it to Sourceforge then. Let's hope that's sooner rather than later, shall we?
					<p>Until next time...
					<p><hr>
					It's baaaack! <a href="Wcalc-1.5-beta2.dmg.sit">New pre-release!</a>
					<p>
					Confronted with a little more time to spare now that school is over and I'm settled into my new apartment, I've been fiddling with Wcalc again. All my notes about planned features were left in my parent's house (hopefully I'll get them re-collected at some point), so I'm on my own to think of new features. (That and I sifted through my email archive.)
					<p>
					I finished (I think!) active variables. They're really cool, and I'm actually kinda proud about how they turned out so far. Give 'em a try, tell me what breaks. I've also added a few more features---Wcalc now supports comments (C-style (<tt>/* */</tt>), C++-style (<tt>//</tt>), and shell-style (<tt>#</tt>)), bitshift operations (<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>), quoted strings for "active" variables (single quote only), live keypresses (it evaluates when you hit '=' in the GUI), and the start of a unit-conversions interface. I made a bunch of little fixes too -- printing prefixes by default, adding sanity to the command-line, etc. There are probably a couple things I've forgotten.
					<p>
					With any luck, I should get the conversion stuff done by the end of the week or so. If I don't find any big bugs or features I promised but forgot before then, I'll post it to VersionTracker and call it 1.5 officially.
					<p>
					You may notice Wcalc has a new home. Well, call me cheap, but I don't have the resources to pony up $50 for some webspace, especially when I get this space for free. Ce est la vie.
					<p><hr>
					Well well... it's been a little while, hasn't it? I've been educating myself about Cocoa (it's wonderful), and I've been thinking about stuff...
					<p>
					Got a new number parser (yeah, I know - I just can't leave it alone!). Basically, it pulls WHATEVER character you want to use as a separator out of the System Preferences! Yay! The holy grail! If you pick something silly like '/' as a separator then '/' will be the new separator and won't have it's old use. Unfortunately you have to quit and re-open Wcalc if you change the System Preferences - otherwise it doesn't know about the change. This one, I think, is up to Apple to change. In the command-line, however, you can change it on the fly with <tt>\tsep</tt> and <tt>\dsep</tt> (it's in the Readme). Anyway - PLEASE TEST IT!
					<p>
					A few other miscelaneous changes... Next on my list of things to add are active variables. Then it'll be exporting/importing files (ooo!). I'm also trying to figure out how to get the keypad clear button to work like it does in Apple's calculator. Text fields don't seem to want to give up control of keyboard events very easily...
					<p>
					<a href="Wcalc-1.5-beta1.dmg.sit">Download it and let me know what you think!</a>
					<p><hr>
					1.4.5 is out!

					Lots of fixes... To my knowledge I've fixed everything people have complained about. Now, to work on new features!
					<p><hr>
					Pre-release 2 is up <a href="Wcalc-1.4.5-pre2.dmg.sit">here</a>.
					<p>
					I have a pre-release version of Wcalc ready <a href="Wcalc-1.4.5-pre1.dmg.sit">here</a>.
					<p>
					I started a Yahoo Groups email list for Wcalc - anyone interested in talking about Wcalc with a larger group, getting emails about features and bugs and the future direction of Wcalc, send a message <a href="mailto:wcalc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">here</a>.
					<p><hr>
					Good grief! 1.4.4 is out... I really need a regiment of tests to run before I release software. Suggestions? Help?
					<p>Damon Bransom has kindly sent me <a href="icons1.jpg">a few icon suggestions</a> - <a href="mailto:kwheeler@cse.nd.edu">what do you think</a>?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.3 is out!
					<p>I can't believe I didn't find these errors earlier. Good grief...
					<p>Someone suggested to me that I start a mailing list, on Yahoo Groups or something, for people interested in Wcalc development (heck, even throw the source out there, GPL it, see if people can help me make it cool). Is this something that's a good idea? Anyone interested? Or should this remain my little hobby?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.2 is out!
					<p>So, I decided to release earlier rather than later. This fixes all but one of the bugs that I *know* about (the other one... eh). Working on customizable functions.
					<p><hr>
					Well, I've got the period/comma problem solved (sorta). I'm treating them interchangeably. I'd <i>like</i> to be able to specify which to use in the preferences, so that 1,000.5 can be interpreted to be one thousand point five (in America) instead of one thousand multiplied by one half - but that's... <b><u>REALLY</u></b> hard at the moment. (If anyone knows how to change the Lex regular expressions on the fly, let me know!)
					<p>I also have the button-click-means-you-can't-type-anymore problem solved. (It was, in the end, a stupid error on my part.) Basically, the setSelectable:TRUE is not the inverse of setSelectable:FALSE.
					<p>I'm currently working on two things:<ul>
						<li>fix the library problems for real this time (I can't figure out how to link libraries in statically - but I'm working on it).
						<li>Add a drawer with all the functions and symbols in it (and put output format (read: hex) controls there... maybe).
					</ul>
					What do you think? More feature suggestions? More bug reports? Are these features good to go? Should I release 1.4.2 (with what is currently fixed) before I release 1.5?
					<p>
					Someone also suggested that I start a listserv for Wcalc. Any seconds?
					<p><hr>
					1.4.1 is out!
					<p>
					This version is almost all bugfixes. It was brought to my attention that there were some really important bugs (particularly with the command-line) that I just had to fix them immediately.
					<p>
					There are still one or two bugs left to quash (aren't there always?)... some of them I'm almost beginning to wonder if it's really me (like the window-resizing thing).
					<p>
					Things I'm looking at for the next version: saving variable sets, user-defined functions, functions of multiple variables... any more suggestions?
					<p><hr>
					1.4 is out!
					<p>
					This version has a bunch of features that have been suggested to me - the history is being saved now, it supports hex,octal,and binary for input and output, the history list also saves the result of the expression. There are also some bug fixes that people noticed - better factorials, clearing out pointless error messages, that kind of thing. I also improved the command-line version a bunch (added new features, implemented the new command syntax, that sort of thing).
					<p>
					As a side-note, MacWorld will be including Wcalc with their May issue!!! (I'm excited!)
					<p>
					I took some of the older versions offline - some were broken, fundamentally, and I need the space on my iDisk.
					<p><hr>
					1.3 is out!
					<p>
					I found another error in the parser (it was doing the order of operations backwards!). Ahh, well... I may have to rewrite it again, from scratch. Anyway - as requested, you can toggle the keypad. I also found a bunch of tables of standard physical constants, and thought it would be neat to add those, and as a way to show it off, I added menus to select them. Fun stuff.
					<p><hr>
					1.2 is out!
					<p>
					Wow. Well, when you start rewriting the parser, I guess you just can't stop until you're completely finished, or things break. Sorry about that, everyone - 1.1 and 1.1.1's parsers were broken, so things didn't work. 1.2 <b>should</b> work -- if it doesn't, let me know right away!
					<p><hr>
					1.1.1 is out! EEEK! A typo in the parser! Ick!
					<p><hr>
					1.1 is out! This fixes a LOT more than I thought it would. I didn't realize the parser was as broken as it was (yow!) - but it's much better now.
					<p>
					The command-line tool needs to be brought up to par with the GUI - there are a few preferences and things of that nature that the GUI has that the command-line tool doesn't. And I may need to create a ~/.wcalcrc to store preferences...
					<p>
					One thing I *still* can't figure out... There seems to be a wierd window-resize bug, where it will get a little bigger to the left, and then the size of the window misbehaves (doesn't follow the mouse). Is this just my machine?</font>
