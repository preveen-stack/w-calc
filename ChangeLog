 - Rewrote the Variable management - now it's simpler, slower, more useful
 - Variable GUI list is functioning!
 - History list selection now replaces the current expression
 - Pickiness about undefined variables is configurable (not in commandline version)
 - Made it approximately the size of Apple's calculator
 - Prefs are their own window now
 - Logging duplicates in the history is configurable (not in commandline version).
 - Need to redo commands in command-line version (perhaps \q to quit, \dups for history dups... eh?)
 - Fixed the boolean thing - now both !4 and 4! work (!4 = 0, 4! = 24, !0 = 1)
 - Discovered that 9+-9 doesn't work... dunno how to fix. I'll think about it. (is this critical?)

 - Fixed the factorial parsing (non-elegant solution)
 - Added GUI Engineering Notation toggle (template for future preferences, if any)
 - Decided I have to rewrite the variable storage mechanism to get the GUI list working. :(
 - Need to save prefs somehow...
